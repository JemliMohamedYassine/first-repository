        <h2>Pasta</h2>
        Pasta (UK: /ˈpæstə/, US: /ˈpɑːstə/; Italian: [ˈpasta]) is a type of food
        typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water
        or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling
        or baking. Pasta was originally only made with durum, although the
        definition has been expanded to include alternatives for a gluten-free
        diet, such as rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils. Pasta is
        believed to have developed independently in Italy and is a staple food
        of Italian cuisine,[1][2] with evidence of Etruscans making pasta as
        early as 400 BCE in Italy.[3][4] Pastas are divided into two broad
        categories: dried (Italian: pasta secca) and fresh (Italian: pasta
        fresca). Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion
        process, although it can be produced at home. Fresh pasta is
        traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple
        machines.[5] Fresh pastas available in grocery stores are produced
        commercially by large-scale machines. Both dried and fresh pastas come
        in a number of shapes and varieties, with 310 specific forms known by
        over 1,300 documented names.[6] In Italy, the names of specific pasta
        shapes or types often vary by locale. For example, the pasta form
        cavatelli is known by 28 different names depending upon the town and
        region. Common forms of pasta include long and short shapes, tubes, flat
        shapes or sheets, miniature shapes for soup, those meant to be filled or
        stuffed, and specialty or decorative shapes.[7] As a category in Italian
        cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of
        three kinds of prepared dishes: as pasta asciutta (or pastasciutta),
        cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary sauce or
        condiment; a second classification of pasta dishes is pasta in brodo, in
        which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish. A third category is pasta
        al forno, in which the pasta is incorporated into a dish that is
        subsequently baked in the oven.[8] Pasta dishes are generally simple,
        but individual dishes vary in preparation. Some pasta dishes are served
        as a small first course or for light lunches, such as pasta salads.
        Other dishes may be portioned larger and used for dinner. Pasta sauces
        similarly may vary in taste, color and texture.[9] In terms of
        nutrition, cooked plain pasta is 31% carbohydrates (mostly starch), 6%
        protein, and low in fat, with moderate amounts of manganese, but pasta
        generally has low micronutrient content. Pasta may be enriched or
        fortified, or made from whole grains.
